### Post 2: Problem-Solution Format
```
📊 Did you know most resumes are rejected by ATS systems before a human even sees them?

I experienced this firsthand and realized:
❌ Paid ATS checkers cost $30-100+
❌ They store your private data
❌ Limited free trials

So I built a solution: AI Resume Matcher

✅ Completely FREE forever
✅ No signup or data storage
✅ AI-powered semantic analysis
✅ Instant feedback in seconds

How it works:
1. Upload your resume (PDF/TXT)
2. Paste the job description
3. Get match score + missing keywords
4. Improve and reapply

Try it: https://esume-job-matcher-ai-shehriyar.streamlit.app

Open source on GitHub. Built with ❤️ for job seekers.

Title: [Tool] I built a free AI Resume Matcher - Get instant feedback on how well your resume matches job descriptions

Body:
Hey r/resumes!

I noticed many people struggle to know if their resume matches specific job descriptions. After helping friends optimize their resumes manually, I decided to build a free AI tool to automate this.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your resume against any job description
- Gives you a 0-100% match score
- Identifies skills and keywords you're missing
- Suggests specific improvements
- Supports PDF and text files

**Why I made it free:**
- No data storage (privacy-focused)
- No signup required
- No hidden costs or trials
- Open source and transparent

**Try it here:** https://esume-job-matcher-ai-shehriyar.streamlit.app

Takes literally 30 seconds to get results. Would love your feedback!

**Example:** If a job description mentions "Python, AWS, Docker" and your resume only has "Python", it will tell you to add AWS and Docker.

Happy to answer any questions!

## Quora Answer Template

**Question:** "How can I check if my resume matches a job description?"

**Answer:**
```
I faced this exact problem, so I built a free AI tool to solve it.

Here's the best way to check:

**Option 1: Manual Method** (Free but time-consuming)
1. Read the job description carefully
2. Highlight all required skills
3. Check if those exact keywords appear in your resume
4. If not, add them where relevant

**Option 2: Use an AI Tool** (Free and fast)
I built a free tool specifically for this: https://esume-job-matcher-ai-shehriyar.streamlit.app

How it works:
- Upload your resume (PDF/TXT)
- Paste the job description
- Get instant match score (0-100%)
- See exactly what skills you're missing
- Get AI-generated suggestions

**Why this matters:**
Most companies use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) that filter resumes by keyword matching. If your resume doesn't have the right keywords, it gets rejected automatically.

**Pro tip:** Tailor your resume for each job application. A generic resume rarely matches well.

The tool is completely free, no signup required, and doesn't store your data.

Hope this helps!
